- 👋 Hi, I’m @L3n1o (Kacper Leńczuk actually)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming/testing. For now I work as automation tester, but maybe someday I'll be java/python dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAva with Spring 5
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on testing (manual/auto) of any project. I can test backend/frontend/mobile
- 📫 How to reach me: mostly Linked.in (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacper-le%C5%84czuk-782334a0/)
